# Interactive CSS Learning Session

Welcome to this interactive learning session on CSS! This project is designed to teach you the fundamentals of CSS through a combination of documentation, a complete example website, and small, focused lessons.

## How to Use This Session

1.  **Start with the Documentation:** Read through the files in the `documentation` directory to get a solid understanding of the core CSS concepts.
2.  **Explore the Shopping Website:** Look at the `shopping-website` directory to see a complete, functional example of a webpage built with HTML and CSS. This will show you how different CSS properties work together.
3.  **Work Through the Lessons:** The `lessons` directory contains smaller, bite-sized examples that break down the components of the shopping website. Each lesson focuses on a specific CSS concept, allowing you to learn in a more focused way.
