# What is CSS?

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

In simple terms, CSS is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

## Why Use CSS?

*   **Separation of Concerns:** CSS allows you to separate the presentation of your website from the HTML structure. This makes your code easier to maintain and understand.
*   **Consistency:** You can use the same CSS rules across multiple pages to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout your website.
*   **Accessibility:** When used correctly, CSS can improve the accessibility of your website by ensuring a clear and readable layout.
*   **Responsive Design:** CSS is essential for creating responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
